                <h2>Chess Pieces</h2>
                <img style="float: left; margin-right: 15px" src="_library/image/basics.png">
                <p>The chess pieces are what you move on a chessboard when playing a game of chess.Each piece in chess has its own unique powers. Chess pieces are divided into two different colored sets. While the sets may not be literally white and black(e.g. the light set may be a yellowish or off-white color, the dark set may be brown or red), they are always referred to as "white" and "black". The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black, respectively. Each set consists of 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. Chess sets come in a wide variety of styles; for competition, the Staunton pattern is preferred. The game is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks) and eight columns (called files). By convention, the 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares; common colors for chessboards are white and brown, or white and dark green. To become great at chess you must understand these powers and how they can be used to win the game.In this page, we will learn about all of the pieces, specifically, where they are placed when a game begins, how they move, and how they are valued.</p>

                <h4 class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-4">Pawn</h4>
                <p>The pawn is the basic piece in chess and each side starts with eight. White pawn will be located on the second rank and black pawn will be located on the seventh rank. Each pawn is worth 1 point. While that may not seem like a lot, many good chess players can win a chess game if they have a 1 point advantage. While the pawn is the weakest piece on the board, it serves a vital role in the game. Most of the early part of the game will be centered around the pawn structure and controlling the center of the board with your pawns. The other pieces will support the pawn in the early stages. Later on the pawns will play more of a supportive role for the minor and major pieces will limiting the squares the opponent can go to.
                <br><br>The pawn is the only piece on the chess board that can’t go backwards. It is also the only piece where you can’t move it the same number of squares the entire game. The first time you move a pawn you can move it one or two squares. Once the pawn has moved you can only move the pawn one square after that. Another distinction is that while the pawn moves forward it can’t capture another piece right in front of it. It can only capture a piece diagonally, but it can’t move diagonally unless it is capturing a piece. If a pawn has reach the last square, it can be changed (promoted) to another chess piece (knight, bishop, rook, or queen)</p>

                <h4 class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-4">Knight</h4>
                <p>The knight is the piece that looks like a horse. Each side will begin with two knights. They will be located in between your rook and bishops on squares b1/g1 for white and b8/g8 for black. The knight is worth 3 points and is considered a minor piece. It is generally considered as strong as a bishop, but for its own unique reasons. While both pieces are worth 3 points, there will be some positions where the knight will reign supreme.
                <br><br>This piece has a very unique movement. The knight is the only piece on the board that can jump over another piece. In that way, the knight has a leg up on the queen, but controls fewer total squares than the queen can. The movement of the knight can be thought of as an L. You can think of it as a two-one or a one-two approach. This means that the knight can move two squares up/down/sideways followed by one square to make an L or it can move one square up/down/sideways followed by two squares to make an L.</p>

                <h4 class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-4">Bishop</h4>
                <p>The bishop is not quite as strong as the rook, and is referred to as a minor piece. It can still cover a lot of ground and works will in pairs. Each side will begin with two bishops. They are located right next to the king and the queen. You will have one bishop that is on the light squares and one bishop on the dark squares. They will always stay on the same color square the entire game. The bishop is worth 3 points in a chess game, equivalent to a knight.
                <br><br>The bishop can move diagonally as many squares as it would like, but bishop can not jumping over another piece. At the beginning of the game bishops are blocked by pawns, but you usually will be moving your pawns early on. The opens up the door for the bishops to get involved in the game. Bishops will be one of the primary pieces you will use in the early game to attack your opponent.</p>

                <h4 class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-4">Rook</h4>
                <p>The rook is the piece that looks like a castle. This is a very strong piece, also referred to as a major piece, and is outranked only by queen. Each side starts with two rooks located in the four corners of the board. Rooks are worth 5 points in chess. While points don’t tell the entire story in a chess game, it does give some indication for how strong a piece is. If you give up a 3 point piece in chess in exchange for your opponents rook, that is generally a good trade for you.
                <br><br>The rook can move any number of squares up, down, left, and right. It can’t jump over material so at the beginning of the game, it also can’t move. At the beginning of the game the rook is surrounded by a pawn and a knight. One mistake that beginners make is they never unleash the rook into the game. The rook rarely gets involved early in the game but you need to find a way later in the game to use the rook or you will have missed out on of your strongest pieces contributing to the game.</p>

                <h4 class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-4">Queen</h4>
                <p>The queen is the piece with a crown on top, but no cross. This is the most powerful chess piece. Like the rook, it is considered a major piece in chess. The queens begin on the d1 and d8 squares. This should be the same color as the queen. If you see the d1 square is a dark square then you need to rotate the board so the d1 square is a light color square. Using the queen correctly is one of the most important parts of chess. It is powerful, so you want to use it, but if it’s not protected your opponent can capture your queen and generally leads to a quick loss. The queen is worth 9 points, which is more than a rook a bishop combined.
                <br><br>The queen combines the moves from the bishop and rook. It can move any squares in a diagonal direction, or go up, down, and sideways as many squares without jumping over another piece. Early in a chess game you usually don’t want to move your queen very much. It will support your pawns, bishops, and knights. As you approach the middle game (15 or so moves into the game), the queen will start to get involved a bit more and play more offense.</p>

                <h4 class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-4">King</h4>
                <p>The king is the piece with a cross at the top. This may not be the most powerful piece in chess, but it certainly is the most important. If you lose your king, you have lost the game. At the beginning of the game you want to make sure to protect your king. Later in the game, the king can become a very powerful ally in your offense so be prepared to use it. The white chess king begins on the e1 square and the black king begins on the e8 square. This should be the opposite color of the king. If the e1 square is white, then you will need to rotate the board so the e1 square is dark.
                <br><br>The king can move one square in any direction. It can’t jump over material so at the start of a chess game there are no legal moves for the king to make since it is surrounded by other pieces. The one limitation the king has when moving is that it can’t move to a square that is being attacked by an opponent’s pieces.</p>
